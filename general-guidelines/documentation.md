# Documentation

All APIs must be documented as if it would go public in the future. API documentation must be understandable, coherent and complete as is. 

## API Description formats

* Internally we use  RAML due to development pipeline and data model complexity and reuse. 
* For public APIs we publish Open API Spec descriptions in PoT Developer Portal. 

## Getting started packages

Each API must have getting started package which enables first great experience in under 3 minutes. The package can be implemented as part of the documentation described below or as separate section in Developer Portal. 

Getting started package utilizes sandbox provided by the PoT.
