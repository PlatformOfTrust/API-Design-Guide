# Naming conventions

## Use snake\_case

Based on an [eye tracking study on camelCase and snake\_case](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5521745) \([PDF](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf)\) from 2010, **snake\_case is 20% easier to read than camelCase**! That impact on readability would affect API explorability and examples in documentation.

However, if you then go the route of building client libraries, SDKs etc in various languages, it's best to use idiomatic naming conventions in them - camelCase for C\# & Java, snake\_case for python & ruby.
