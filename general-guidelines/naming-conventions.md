# Naming conventions

## Use camelCase

We use camelCase in API parameters and attribute names JSON payloads. 



## Libraries are different

However, if you then go the route of building client libraries, SDKs etc in various languages, it's best to use idiomatic naming conventions in them - camelCase for C\# & Java, snake\_case for python & ruby.
