## PoT guidelines for editing the ontology

* Make increments. You can add new subclasses under the current classes. You can also add new properties.
* Add missing annotations and refine existing ones.
* Be logical and semantically consistent.

DON'Ts

* Do not delete anything from the PoT Core Ontology. You are allowed to delete only the classes that you have added yourself.
* Do not edit the class or property names of PoT Core Ontology. You are allowed to edit only the names of the classes you have added.
* Do not change the types of relations between the current classes. You are allowed to change only the relation types of the classes you have added.

If any of the above restrictions is not followed, it may cause a breaking change.
